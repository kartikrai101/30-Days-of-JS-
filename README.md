<h1>30 days of JS</h1>
<hr>
<p>This repository contains a bunch of small projects that I made during my own 30 days of JS series! The main goal is to brush up most of the features of JS and get a hold on some of the key concepts of JS.</p>
<p>I have made use of pure HTML, CSS and JS and no framework or library to ensure that I use JS to the full extent, which is the whole concept of this series.</p>
